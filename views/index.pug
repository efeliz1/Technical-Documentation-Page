						b Java 
						| was developed by 
						b Sun Microsystems Inc 
						| in the year 1991, later acquired by Oracle |Corporation. It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming |language. Java	makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create |reusable code and modular programs.

						p It used for : 
							ul
								li Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
								li Desktop applications
								li Web applications
								li Web servers and application servers
								li Games
								li Database connection
								li And much, much more!

				arcticle
					P
						|	Java is a well dynamic programing languege for beginner and it share lots of the characteristis of the top level language.
					ul
						li Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
						li It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
						li It is easy to learn and simple to use
						li It is open-source and free
						li It is secure, fast and powerful
						li It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
						li Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs

					p Many PC are different, this would be structor for windows users.

					p First let verify if Java is installed on your PC, search for the command line or command prompt(cmd) and type with me:

					div.example
						div.example-gold
							code
								p#command c:\Users\[Your Name]> Java -version
								button#copy(type="button" ) Copy

					p If Java is installed, you will see something similar as this.

					div.example
						div.example-gold
							code
								p#command 
									|java version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16 LTS <br />
									|java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS) <br />
									|java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)

					p If is not installed you will have to download requirements
					ul
						li Java Development Kit
							a(href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html") &nbsp; ➡ Download
						p 
							|This is a Java a compiler created by Oracle, The Java compiler helps translate are code to |java so the computer understand what is are instruction.
						li Eclipse or any other IDE
							a(href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/") &nbsp; ➡ Download
						p 
							|It is an IDE where you will write, deploy and test your code. It the equivalent of Microsoft word but design for code writing this tool would help you write better code. There are ton of IDE and I recommend to try them all and stick to your favorite because moving around to different IDE gets messy.

					p After Downloading and installing open up eclipse
						ul
							li Go to top menu ↪ File ↪ New ↪ Java Project
					img#image-1(src="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/labs/EclipseTutorial/images/new_project.png" alt="eclipse creating new file")
					p In project name: HelloWorld 
					img#image-1(src="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/labs/EclipseTutorial/images/new_java_project_wizard.png")
					p After finishing you will see the project folder
					img#image-1(src="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/labs/EclipseTutorial/images/non_empty_workspace.png")
					p Right-Click the folder ↪ New ↪ Class
					img#image-1(src="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/labs/EclipseTutorial/images/new_class.png")
					p In name: HelloWorld
					img#image-1(src="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/labs/EclipseTutorial/images/new_class_wizard.png")
					p Now that we complete the setup, let write a little program.
					img#image-1(src="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/labs/EclipseTutorial/images/hello_world.png")
					p In the bottom theirs a console with the output.

					P
						|	Java is a Object-Oriented Programing languege and every line of code you will write run must be inside a Class.
						| In around example, we name the class Main. A class should always start with an unppercase first letter.
					ul
						li Note: Java is case-sentive: "MyObject" and "myobject" are different meaning to java.
					p The main() method is required and you will see it in very programn and any code that is inside would be excute.
					div.example
						div.example-gold
							code
								p#command 
									|public static void main(String[] args)
					p System.out.println()

					li Inside main(), we have use thee println() method to print a line on screen.
					div.example
						div.example-gold
							code
								p#command 
									|public static void main(String[] args) { <br/>
									| &nbsp; System.out.println("Hello World");
									|<br/> }
			section.main-section#Comments
				header Comments
				arcticle
					P
						|	Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
					ul
						li Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
						li Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).
					p Example
					div.example
						div.example-gold
							code
								p#command
									| // This is a comment 
									|System.out.println("Hello World");
					p Java Multi-line Comments


					li Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
					li Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.
					div.example
						div.example-gold
							code
								p#command 
									|/* The code below will print the words Hello World <br/>
									| to the screen, and it is amazing */
									|<br/> System.out.println("Hello World");
			section.main-section#Variables
				header Variables
				arcticle
					P
						|	Variables are containers for storing data values.
						|<br/> In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:
					ul
						li String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
						li int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
						li float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
						li char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
						li boolean - stores values with two states: true or false
					p Example: Declaring (creating) Variable
					div.example
						div.example-gold
							code
								p#command
									| type variable = value;
									
					p Example: String

					div.example
						div.example-gold
							code
								p#command 
									|String name = "Edwin"; <br/>
									|System.out.println(name);
					p Example: int

					div.example
						div.example-gold
							code
								p#command 
									|int num = 29; <br/>
									|System.out.println(num);

					p Example: Final Vairable

					div.example
						div.example-gold
							code
								p#command 
									|final int myNum = 15; <br/>
									|myNum = 29; // will compile an error because cannot assign a value to a final vairable it is constant.
